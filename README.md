# github-final-project1

Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator open-source project. 
This project is part of our micro-finance startup's journey to empower and provide 
opportunities to low-income individuals by transitioning from Subversion to Git

About the Project
- This repo contains a sample code script for calulating simple interest.
It's our first step in embracing Git and open source collaboration.
We belive that by sharing our code with the community,
we can learn from others and contribute to a greater cause.
